## üîí Reporting a Vulnerability

At Secure Messaging App, we take security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at:

**Email**: faezaraziqg@gmail.com

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability
- Path or location of the vulnerable code
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Impact of the vulnerability
- Any potential mitigations you've identified
- Whether you'd like to be credited for the finding (and if so, how you'd like to be credited)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Communication**: We will keep you informed of the progress towards fixing and releasing the necessary patches.
- **Disclosure**: We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features & Practices

### Encryption Implementation

Secure Messaging App uses a multi-layered encryption approach:

1. **Key Exchange**: RSA-4096 for secure exchange of session keys
2. **Message Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for all message content
3. **Message Authentication**: GCM mode provides authentication and integrity verification

### Security Measures

- **Zero Storage**: No message content is stored on the server
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: New session keys are generated regularly
- **No Backdoors**: The entire codebase is open source and auditable
- **Modern Cryptography**: Using only well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and implementations
- **Secure Key Management**: Proper handling of cryptographic keys with secure memory management

## üîç Security Audits

This application has not yet undergone a formal security audit. We are actively seeking security researchers to review our implementation.

If you are interested in conducting a security audit of this application, please contact us.

## üîÑ Dependency Management

We regularly monitor our dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated tools. Updates for security patches are prioritized and applied as soon as possible.

## üìö Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Keep Your Client Updated**: Always use the latest version to benefit from security updates
2. **Verify Identity**: Always verify the identity of the person you're communicating with
3. **Secure Your Device**: Keep your device secure to protect the client application
4. **Report Suspicious Activity**: If you notice anything unusual, report it immediately

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- This application does not provide protection against endpoint compromise (if your device is compromised, the encryption cannot protect your messages)
- The application does not implement perfect forward secrecy at the device level (if your long-term private key is compromised, past messages could potentially be decrypted)
